# Github Report


This is a node project in which I used TypedScript to fetch Github deatails of a user and show top 5 repos according to the number of forks on each repo in descending order.


### To run the app

This command-line app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies.

```sh
$ cd github-report
$ npm install -d
```

To run the app use 

```sh
$ npm start <github_username>
$ npm start jasmeet17
```
